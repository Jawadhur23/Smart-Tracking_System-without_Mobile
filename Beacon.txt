Ladies and gentlemen of the Judgement team,

Today, I am excited to present to you a comprehensive overview of the cutting-edge tracking technology that has emerged as the best option in 2023 when comparing various tracking solutions, specifically focusing on beacon technology and geofencing. Our innovation lies in the advancement of beacon technology, particularly with the utilization of ESP32-based beacons. I will delve into the key differences between our beacons and traditional beacons, as well as the multitude of tracking capabilities they offer.

Let's begin by addressing the foundation of our tracking solution - the ESP32-based beacon. The ESP32 is a powerful and versatile microcontroller that forms the core of our tracking devices. One of the standout features is its configurability. Our beacons can be tailored to fit a variety of scenarios - from one-to-many tracking configurations to point-to-point setups. This adaptability ensures that our solution can be seamlessly integrated into various use cases, providing flexibility that is unmatched by traditional beacons.

Speaking of traditional beacons, it's important to highlight the stark differences between them and our advanced beacons. While standard beacons offer basic tracking capabilities, our ESP32-based beacons take it a step further. Not only do they possess the fundamental features of location tracking, but they also excel in terms of cost-effectiveness. The economies of scale enabled by mass production drastically reduce production costs, paving the way for wider adoption and accessibility.

I would like to draw your attention to the uniqueness of our approach. We acknowledge that introducing a new product to the Indian market can pose challenges, particularly in terms of understanding and acceptance. However, we firmly believe that as practical applications of our technology become more evident, the understanding and demand for our product will follow suit. By optimizing our production processes and reducing costs, we anticipate a surge in demand, thereby increasing market value.

Now, let's discuss the indoor tracking localization methods at the core of our technology. We have harnessed the power of four distinct approaches - Ultra Wideband, WiFi, Ultrasound, and Bluetooth Low Energy. This comprehensive integration ensures accuracy and reliability in indoor tracking scenarios. Our solution is designed to be user-friendly and easily understandable, making it accessible to a wide range of users, even those unfamiliar with advanced tracking technologies. The concept of our product, akin to a neckband, is simple yet effective, further contributing to its ease of use and adoption.

In conclusion, our ESP32-based beacon technology represents a paradigm shift in indoor tracking. The amalgamation of advanced features, configurability, cost-effectiveness, and the integration of multiple localization methods sets us apart from traditional options. As we navigate the challenges of introducing a new product to the Indian market, we are confident that practical applications will drive understanding and demand, ultimately leading to increased market value. The benefits of our indoor tracking solution are vast and varied, promising accuracy, reliability, and simplicity - a trifecta that positions us as leaders in this rapidly evolving field.

Thank you for your attention, and I am now open to any questions you may have.
